  - Max size: 10m
  - Max files: 3

Security:
  - no-new-privileges: true
  - Restart policy: unless-stopped
```

### Next Steps
1. Consider implementing any features from the legacy configuration if needed
2. Monitor and adjust logging settings as needed
3. Consider adding more specific troubleshooting steps based on usage patterns

### Notes for AI Agents
- This is a home project, not an enterprise solution
- Documentation should be practical and minimal
- Legacy configurations are preserved for reference
- Focus on maintainability and ease of use
- Security settings are in place but can be adjusted based on needs
